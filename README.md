Java 2048 Game

Overview
This is a simple implementation of the popular 2048 game in Java. The game is played on a 4x4 grid where the player combines tiles with matching numbers to create a tile with the number 2048.

How to Play
Use the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to move the tiles on the grid.
When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with the sum of their numbers.
After each move, a new tile with the number 2 is randomly added to an empty spot on the grid.
The game ends when there are no more possible moves (i.e., when the grid is full and no adjacent tiles can be merged).

Features
Colorful and user-friendly graphical interface.
Tile colors change dynamically based on their numeric value.
Score is displayed at the end of the game, representing the highest tile value reached.
The game window can be closed once the game is over.

Dependencies
This game uses the Swing framework for creating the graphical user interface.
